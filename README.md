# ✨ word-counter-AI ✨

Why would you want to count the words in simple, efficient and reliable way if u can use ✨AI✨ for that

`word-counter-AI` isn’t just another dull word-counting tool it’s your golden ticket to ✨tech wizardry✨! Fueled by Google’s Gemini 1.5 Flash model, it fearlessly takes on the Herculean challenge of counting words in a sentence.

Does it frequently (okay, fine mostly) mess up the numbers? Absolutely. But who cares when your code looks like it’s been pulled straight from a B-grade sci-fi flick? To the tech-illiterate masses, it screams innovation! (Think Idiocracy, but with better branding).

Because let’s face it, coding isn’t always about solving problems it’s about looking like you’ve hacked the Matrix and are sipping martinis on a neon-lit hovercraft. Toss in a dash of "AI magic," and watch as people marvel at your ✨genius✨. Efficiency is overrated anyway what really matters is ✨vibes✨. 😉
